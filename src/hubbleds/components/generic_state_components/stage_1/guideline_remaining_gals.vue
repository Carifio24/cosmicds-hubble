        Your measurement of the lineâ€™s observed wavelength is now recorded in the table for your selected galaxy.

      <p>
        Go through each of the remaining galaxies in your table and repeat these measurements, until you have recorded rest and observed wavelengths for each of your galaxies.

        You have measured the spectral line wavelengths for all of your galaxies.

        You can continue to refine your measurements, or, if you are satisfied with your measurements, you can move on.
