        To understand Hubble’s thinking about this, let’s use the following situation as a model: Imagine runners in the middle of a race, where the runners are running at different speeds.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this diagram, runner A is running with a velocity of 4 km per hour and has run a distance of 12 km, while runner C is running faster with a velocity of 10 km per hour and has gone a distance of 30 km.
      </p>
      <p>
        Can you figure out how long ago the race started — the “age” of the race? (Assume each runner has maintained a consistent speed for the entire race).
