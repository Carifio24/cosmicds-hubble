        Some uncertainties are <strong>systematic</strong>. These are problems with our methods or assumptions that lead to all measurements, on average, being <strong>incorrect in the same direction</strong>, which biases our final result.
      </p>
      <p>
        Can you think of any problems in our methods that could bias everyoneâ€™s results in the same direction?
