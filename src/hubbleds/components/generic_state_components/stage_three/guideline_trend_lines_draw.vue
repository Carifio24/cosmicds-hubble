        Even when data are messy, it is possible to explore relationships between the quantities being graphed. Scientists do this by fitting a <strong>model</strong> to the data. Often, they start with a trend line. A <strong>trend line</strong> (or best-fit line) is a line that most accurately fits the data and minimizes the total distance between all the points and the line.
